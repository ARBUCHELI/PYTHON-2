# PROJECT

* Area Calculator
-----------------
Python is especially useful for doing math and can be used to automate many calculations. In this project, we’ll create a calculator that can compute the area of the following shapes:

	. Circle

	. Triangle

The program should do the following:

	1. Prompt the user to select a shape.

	2. Calculate the area of that shape.

	3. Print the area of that shape to the user.

Let’s begin!

Tasks
17/17 complete
Mark the tasks as complete by checking them off
1.
Begin by writing a multi-line comment that describes what this program does, starting on line 1.


Hint
It’s helpful to let other programmers know what your program does.

"""
This is a 
multi-line
comment!
"""

For this program, you can write something like:

"""
Codecademy - Learn Python
Area Calculator
"""

2.
Let’s inform the user that the program is running.

Print a message to let the user know the calculator is starting up.


Hint
print "Starting the calculator..."

Remember, you are playing two roles here:

	. the programmer

	. the user

When you are writing the code, you are the programmer. However, you need to be constantly thinking from the users’ point of view – they are the ones who run your program.

3.
Next, ask the user what shape to calculate the area of using raw_input(), which works like:

name = raw_input("What's your name? ")

Prompt the user for input with the following message: "Enter C for Circle or T for Triangle: ".

Store their input into a variable called option.


Hint
option = raw_input("Enter C for Circle or T for Triangle: ")

raw_input() presents a string to the user, gets input from the user and returns the data in a string.

Here, the code is asking the user to enter C or T, and saving whatever they enter into the variable option.

4.
Great! Now it’s time to calculate the area of the shape that the user specifies.

Write an if statement that will check if the option the user entered is 'C' for circle.


Hint
if option == 'C':

This code translates to: if option is equal to the character C, then do the following…

5.
For the next few steps, we will be writing code inside the if statement.

Prompt the user to input the radius.

Store their input into a variable called radius.


Hint
if option == 'C':
  radius = raw_input("Enter radius: ")

The indentation puts this line inside the if statement.

6.
Using raw_input() alone will store the user’s input as a string. Since we want to do some calculations with the user’s input, we need numbers, not strings.

Python has a built-in method called float() that converts a string to a floating point number.

Put the raw_input("Enter radius: ") part of your code inside float() parenthesises like this:

radius = float(raw_input("Enter radius: "))


Hint
Your if statement so far should look like:

if option == 'C':
  radius = float(raw_input("Enter radius: "))

This will make sure we are storing the user’s input as a floating point number. We’ll then be able to perform calculations with their input.

7.
Calculate the area of a circle now that you have the radius.

area = π r²

	. Use 3.14159 for the value of pi.

	. Use exponentiation ** to square.

Store the result in a variable called area.


Hint
if option == 'C':
  radius = float(raw_input("Enter radius: "))
  area = 3.14159 * radius**2

8.
Finally, on the next line, print the area using string formatting.


Hint
The % operator after a string is used to combine a string with variables.

quarter = 0.25
print "A quarter is %f" % (quarter)

The % operator will replace a %f in the string with the floating point number variable that comes after it.

if option == 'C':
  radius = float(raw_input("Enter radius: "))
  area = 3.14159 * radius**2  
  print "Area: %f" % area

9.
You’ve completed the part of the program that calculates the area of a circle – it’s a good time to test the code!

First, click Save. Then, in the terminal, type the following command and press enter:

python AreaCalculator.py


Hint
Executing this command in the terminal tells the computer to run the AreaCalculator.py program.

	. Type C and hit enter for the first prompt.

	. Type 9 and hit enter for the second prompt.

When your program finishes, it should look something like:

$ python AreaCalculator.py
Starting the calculator...
Enter C for Circle or T for Triangle: C
Enter radius: 9
Area: 254.468790

If you are getting an error, make sure to debug (check your code for typos or mistakes) before repeating this task.

When you are in the terminal:

	. Make sure the program finishes running before editing the code again.

	. To abort: control + c

If all else fails, refresh the browser!

10.
Great! It’s time to move on to the next shape: the triangle.

Add a corresponding elif statement to your if statement.

The elif statement should check if the option the user entered is 'T' for triangle.


Hint
if option == 'C':
  # ...
elif option == 'T':

This code translates to: else if option is equal to the character T, then do the following…

11.
For the next few steps, you will be staying inside the elif statement.

To calculate the area of a triangle, first ask the user to enter the base of the triangle.

Store the user’s input in a variable called base.

Convert the user’s input from a string to a number by using float().


Hint
if option == 'C':
  # ...
elif option == 'T':
  base = float(raw_input("Enter base: "))

12.
The height of the triangle is also needed to calculate its area.

Ask the user to enter the height of the triangle and store the input in a variable called height.

Convert the user’s input from a string to a number by using float().


Hint
if option == 'C':
  # ...
elif option == 'T':
  base = float(raw_input("Enter base: "))
  height = float(raw_input("Enter height: "))

13.
Next, calculate the area and store it in a variable called area.

area = ½ b h


Hint
elif option == 'T':
  base = float(raw_input("Enter base: "))
  height = float(raw_input("Enter height: "))
  area = 0.5 * base * height

14.
Finally, print the area using string formatting.


Hint
elif option == 'T':
  base = float(raw_input("Enter base: "))
  height = float(raw_input("Enter height: "))
  area = 0.5 * base * height
  print "Area: %f" % area

15.
Fantastic! The user can now specify C for circle or T for triangle.

But what if the user enters something else?

Add an else block to handle this possible case.

Inside the else block, print a message to inform the user that they entered an invalid shape.


Hint
if option == 'C':
  # ...
elif option == 'T':
  # ...
else:
  print "Error! Invalid shape."

16.
Last line of the program!

Outside of the if statement, inform the user that the program is exiting.


Hint
if option == 'C':
  # ...
elif option == 'T':
  # ...
else:
  # ...

print "Exiting..."

17.
Now we’re ready to try the program out!

First, click Save. Then, in the terminal, type the following command and press enter:

python AreaCalculator.py

Congratulations!


Hint
Check your program by confirming the following two examples:

	. For a circle: inputting 6 for the radius outputs 113.097240.

	. For a triangle: inputting 33 for the base and 11 for the height outputs 181.500000.

Congratulations, you have a working area calculator!

If you are feeling ambitious, try adding the functionality to calculate the area of other shapes, like a square or a rectangle. Happy coding!
