# PYTHON SYNTAX
---------------

* Hello World!
--------------

If programming is the act of teaching a computer to have a conversation with a user, it would be most useful to first teach the computer how to speak. In Python, this is accomplished with 
the print statement.

print "Hello, world!"
print "Water; there is not a drop of water there! Were Niagara but a cataract of sand, would you travel your thousand miles to see it?"

A print statement is the easiest way to get your Python program to communicate with you. Being able to command this communication will be one of the most valuable tools in your 
programming toolbox.

* Print Statements
------------------
There are two different Python versions. Both Python 2 and Python 3 are used throughout the globe. The most significant difference between the two is how you write a print statement. In 
Python 3, print has parentheses.

print("Hello World!")
print("Deep into distant woodlands winds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in their hill-side blue.")

In this course we will be using Python 2. If you go on to write Python 3 it will be useful to note this key difference.

* Instructions
--------------
Checkpoint 1 Passed
1.
Print something using Python 3â€™s syntax.


Hint
Remember to include parentheses!

print("Your message!")
