# STRINGS & CONSOLE OUTPUT
--------------------------

* Strings
---------
2 min
Another useful data type is the string. A string can contain letters, numbers, and symbols.

name = "Ryan"
age = "19"
food = "cheese"

	1. In the above example, we create a variable name and set it to the string value "Ryan".

	2. We also set age to "19" and food to "cheese".

Strings need to be within quotes.

1.
Create a new variable brian and assign it the string "Hello life!".


Hint
Do you remember how to declare and assign variables in Python? If not, refresh your memory here!

There is no difference between using single quotes ' and double quotes ". However, sometimes it is helpful to use one or the other. If we want to include an apostrophe in our string, it 
would be smart to use double quotes to create the string like "I'm a string". If we want to use quotes in the string, we might want to create the string with single quote like 'The man 
screamed "I love Python!" so that everyone could hear.'

script.py
---------
# Set the variable brian on line 3!
brian = "Hello life!"

Excellent! Letâ€™s get a little practice in with strings.

* Instructions

Checkpoint 1 Passed
1.
Set the following variables to their respective phrases:

	1. Set caesar to "Graham"

	2. Set praline to "John"

	3. Set viking to "Teresa"

Hint
Make sure you use exactly the capitalization shown! Python takes things very literally.

script.py
---------
# Assign your variables below, each on its own line!
caesar = "Graham"
praline = "John"
viking = "Teresa"




# Put your variables above this line

print caesar
print praline
print viking
